# Course Materials

Course material will be made available via [GitHub](https://github.com/nickgood/r_for_fire_data). The classes will be largely example driven. We'll cover some areas in more detail than others, frequently returning to topics in more detail as we progress.

# Installing R

R is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). There are distribution for multiple platforms (Linux, OS X and Windows). CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a network of servers from which the lastest versions of base R, R packages, and R documentation can be downloaded. Choose a CRAN mirror close to your current location.

<div class = "blue">
```
 * Install the precompiled R distribution for your platform.
```
</div>

# Installing RStudio

Install RStudio from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is your interfece with R. Download the free version of *RStudio Desktop*.

<div class = "blue">
```
 * Install RStudio.

# Navigating RStudio

We'll start by taking a brief tour of RStudio and get a feel for some basic R tasks. RStudio has a default four pane window layout.

The ***source panel*** allows you to open files for editing. RStudio have developed a number of file types that you can use to document and present your work.

<div class = "blue">
```
 1. Open a new R Notebook: file -> new file -> R Notebook
 2. Save the notebook file and rename it
 3. Preview the file
 4. Edit and resave the file (e.g. give it a new title "week one")
 5. Run the code chunk using the green arrow
 6. Preview the file again
```
</div>

The ***console*** panel is where you can pass commands to R. Let's try out some useful commands. 

<div class = "blue">
```
One at a time, type each of the following commands into the console and press return:

  seq(1, 10, 0.5)

  round(pi, 1)

  Sys.time()
  
  ?list.files()
  
  plot(cars)

Does R care if you use upper or lower case characters?

What does prefixing a command with the ? symbol do?

```
</div>

The ***environment*** panel allows you to view R objects et cetera in your working environment. Different object types are grouped together in the ***environment*** panel. There is also ***history*** tab in this panel, where you can view commands you have run.

<div class = "blue">
```
One at a time, type each of the following commands into the console and press return:

  my_sequence <- seq(1, 10, 0.5)

  round_pi <- round(pi, 1)

  the_time <- Sys.time()
  
Take a look at the console tab. What do you see?

```
</div>

The fourth panel contains the ***files***, ***plots***, ***packages***, ***help***, and ***viewer*** tabs. The ***files*** tab allows you to browse your local system directory. Graphics can be viwed in the ***plots*** tab. Package information is displayed in the ***packages*** tab. You can use the ***help*** tab to seach for function information. Documents generated by RStudio can be viewed in the ***viewer*** tab.

<div class = "blue">
```
Select the files, plots, packages, help, and viewer tabs in turn.

What do you see in each tab?
```
</div>

RStudio settings can be customomized via the ***preferences*** menu item.

# Working directory

The working directory is the folder that works in unless you tell R otherwise. The `getwd()` command returns your current working directory. The `setwd(...)` command allows you to set the working directory.

<div class = "blue">
```
 Run the getwd() command in the console. Where is your current working directory?
```
</div>

When working with R you'll very soon want to create a way to organize your work. RStudio facilitates organizing your work using `projects`. Let's create our first RStudio project. Select `file` -> `new project` -> `new directory` -> `empty project`, select a directory and name for your project.

<div class = "blue">
```
 Run getwd() again. What does it return?
 
 Run setwd(..) 
 
 Set the working directory to your project directory 
```
</div>

# R objects and assignment

R is [object oriented](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#base-types). To create an object use the assignment operator `<-`. The `<-` operator is recommmended over `=` that also works.

# Names

R is fairly liberal in terms of object names it will allow. For your sanity its worth impoing some rules of your own:

* use lower case characters.

* separate words with `_`.

* never start a name with a number.

* use `a-z`, `0-9` and `_` only.

# Comments

Use `#` to comment your code.

```{r, results = 'markup'}
 # this is a comment
 # comments are not evaluated
  print(8 * 10) # comments can be placed after code on the same line
 # use comments to concisely document your code
```

# Help!

To display text for a function type a `?` before the function

```{r}
  ?help
```
