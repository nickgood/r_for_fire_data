# Course Materials

Course material will be made available via [GitHub](https://github.com/nickgood/r_for_fire_data). The classes will be largely example driven. We'll cover some areas in more detail than others, frequently returning to topics as we progress.

<div class = "blue">
```
 * Navigate to the course Github page and view this document.
```

# Installing R

R is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). There are distributions for multiple platforms (Linux, OS X and Windows). CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a network of servers from which the lastest versions of base R, R packages, and R documentation can be downloaded. Choose a CRAN mirror close to your current location.

<div class = "blue">
```
 * Install the precompiled R distribution for your platform.
```
</div>

# Installing RStudio

Install RStudio from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is your interfece with R. Download the free version of *RStudio Desktop*.

<div class = "blue">
```
 * Install RStudio.
```

# Navigating RStudio

We'll start by taking a brief tour of RStudio and get a feel for some basic R tasks. RStudio has a default four pane window layout.

The ***source*** pane allows you to open files for editing. RStudio have developed a number of file types that you can use to document and present your work.

![](images/pane_source.PNG)
<br>

The ***console*** pane is where you can pass commands to R.

![](images/pane_console.PNG)
<br>

Let's try out some commands.:

<div class = "blue">

```
One at a time, type each of the following commands into the console and press return:

  seq(1, 10, 0.5)

  round(pi, 1)

  Sys.time()
  
  ?list.files()
  
  plot(cars)

Does R care if you use upper or lower case characters?

What does prefixing a command with the ? symbol do?

```
</div>

The ***environment*** pane allows you to view R objects et cetera in your working environment. Different object types are grouped together in the ***environment*** panel. There is also ***history*** tab in this panel, where you can view commands you have run.

![](images/pane_environment.PNG)
<br>

At present your ***environment*** pane will be empty. We'll add some items to the environment in the next section.

The final panel contains the ***files***, ***plots***, ***packages***, ***help***, and ***viewer*** tabs. The ***files*** tab allows you to browse your local system directory. Graphics can be viwed in the ***plots*** tab. Package information is displayed in the ***packages*** tab. You can use the ***help*** tab to seach for function information. Documents generated by RStudio can be viewed in the ***viewer*** tab.

![](images/pane_file.PNG)
<br>

Let's take a look at the different tabs:

<div class = "blue">
```
Select the files, plots, packages, help, and viewer tabs in turn.

What do you see in each tab?
```
</div>

RStudio settings can be customomized via the ***preferences*** menu item.

# Working directory

The working directory is the folder that works in unless you tell R otherwise. The `getwd()` command returns your current working directory. The `setwd(...)` command allows you to set the working directory.

<div class = "blue">
```
 Run the getwd() command in the console. Where is your current working directory?
```
</div>

# RStudio projects

When working with R you'll very soon want to create a way to organize your work. RStudio facilitates organizing your work using `projects`. Let's create our first RStudio project. Select `file` -> `new project` -> `new directory` -> `empty project`, select a directory and name for your project.

<div class = "blue">
```
 Run getwd() again. What does it return?
 
 Run setwd(..) 
 
 Set the working directory back to your project directory
```
</div>

# Saving your work

There are multiple ways to save your work in R/RStudio. There are basic R scripts (`.R files`) and more elaborate markdown (`.Rmd`) documents for example

Let's create a file to save our work in. We'll create an `R Notebook` file, a special type of file that can be used to document our work in an easy to read and reproducible format.

<div class = "blue">
```
 1. Open a new R Notebook: file -> new file -> R Notebook
 2. Save the notebook file and rename it.
 3. Preview the file by pressing the preview button.
 4. Edit and resave the file (e.g. give it a new title e.g. "week one")
 5. Run the code chunk using the green arrow.
 6. Preview the file again.
 7. Remove the example text.
 8. You can use this file for the rest of today's class.
```
</div>

# R objects and assignment

R is [object oriented](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#base-types). To create an object use the assignment operator `<-`. The `<-` operator is recommmended over `=` that also works.

<div class = "blue">
```
One at a time, type each of the following commands into the console and press return:

  my_dataframe <- data_frame(x = seq(1, 20, 1), y = rnorm(20))
  
  my_lm <- lm(y ~ x, my_dataframe)

Take a look in your enviroment window, what do you see?
```
</div>

R objects have a class associated with them. Different methods (functions) can be applied to objects of different classes. You can use the `class()` function to determine an object's class.

<div class = "blue">
```
Use the class() function to determine the class of each objects in your working environment.

Run the following code one line at a time:

  summary(my_dataframe)

  plot(my_dataframe)

  summary(my_lm)

  plot(my_lm)
```
</div>

# Names

R is fairly liberal in terms of object names it will allow. For your sanity its worth impoing some rules of your own:

* use lower case characters.

* separate words with `_`.

* never start a name with a number.

* use `a-z`, `0-9` and `_` only.

---

# Comments

Use `#` to comment your code.

```{r, results = 'markup'}
 # this is a comment
 # comments are not evaluated
  print(8 * 10) # comments can be placed after code on the same line
 # use comments to concisely document your code
```

---

# Help!

To display text for a function type a `?` before the function

```{r}
  ?help
```

<div class = "blue">
```
View the help documenation for the following functions:
  mean()
  lm()
  data_frame()
  sort()

```
</div>
